# meteor-react-todos
Coding along with the Meteor React Todos tutorial.

## Notes
* deviating from tutorial a little bit
    * using a slightly different directory structure to more strictly organize containers and components
    * using React-Komposer instead of react-meteor-data
* NOW SWITCHING TO ultimatejs:tracker-react
    * NOTE didn't see an easy / straightforward pattern with react-komposer, for event handling (passing handlers via props); will give tracker-react a try
*
